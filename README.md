# Renewable-Energy-Forecast
Machine Learning Application

This project focuses on forecasting renewable energy generation using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze historical energy data, identify patterns, and build models that can predict future energy production to support better planning and decision-making in sustainable energy systems.

## Project Overview

Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are highly dependent on weather and environmental conditions, making accurate forecasting essential. This project:

- Analyzes historical renewable energy data

- Performs data cleaning and preprocessing

- Applies machine learning models for forecasting

- Visualizes trends and predictions

- Evaluates model performance

The final outcome is a predictive system that helps estimate future renewable energy generation.

## Objectives

- Understand patterns in renewable energy data

- Preprocess and clean real-world datasets

- Build forecasting models using machine learning

- Evaluate and compare model performance

- Visualize actual vs predicted energy generation

## Approach

- Data loading and exploration

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, etc.)

- Feature engineering

- Model training (e.g., Regression / Time Series / ML models)

- Model evaluation

- Visualization of results and forecasts

## Tech Stack

Language: Python

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib / Seaborn, scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch for advanced models
